Report
======================

After running through the analysis, you have the option to download a report. When doing so, a zip file is downloaded to your computer, encompassing all input data files, along with an analysis report presented in both R markdown and HTML formats. The R markdown document comprises all the code chunks necessary for the analysis as selected in the app, alongside several pertinent figures. 
You can customize the report by choosing the number of detail plots you wish to include. This will generate the same plots in the Detail plot tab from section 6, starting from the most significant feature. If needed, the generated R markdown can be utilized as a foundation for adapting the workflow's R code to meet your specific requirements.
